# F-Sharp-Projects
# Summary
For my masters program, I enrolled in a Distributed Operating Principles course that consisted of four projects using the Actor Model functional programing paradigm. By distributing work to indepdendent "actors" or nodes, complex computations can be done quicker.
# Technologies
## F# and Akka
The first project was to create a bitcoin generator to familiarize with the Akka actor model and F# syntax. 
The second project involved implementing the "Gossip" algorithm among separate "actors" (similar to separate threads in Java) to spread a message (gossip) amongst all nodes as fast as possible. We then did this with summing a number and passing it along (push-sum algorithm).
For the third project my partner and I implemented a data structure known as "Chord" which was described within a research paper given by the professor. A Chord is similar to a Linked List, but uses a different itteration mechanism to jump to specific nodes.
The fourth project was to re-create Twitter using F# web framework known as Websharper
